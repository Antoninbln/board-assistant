## What's the project ?
Board assistant is a personal project which consists on showing different information on a screen (list non-exaustive) :
- Bus hours
- Weather
- And it can play spotify songs thanks to vocal recognition

App can be displayed on a browser with a Reaspberry Pi.
**For short term** : Each kind of information is displayed in a component which is a part of the interface, and with vocal recognition you can play a song from Spotify.
**For long term** : Each component should began a view, and vocal recognition should be used for navigation through views. This way you can say "Show me the weather", and weather route should be rendered as view.

#### 2. How to use
Special mention for Spotify users ; yYou'll be able to use some vocal commands, here is the list : 
- `album`: play an album
- `joue`: play a song (with this you can ask **song title**, **singer name** & **album name** all combined in command)
- `pause`: pause current track
- `play`: resume track
- `suivant`: play next track
- `prÃ©cÃ©dent`: play previous track
- `avance`: go forward in the track
- `recule`: go backward in the track
- `*anything`: Everything you say which doesn't trigger a command is displayed on screen, so you have a feedback on what is understood by the application.
- `test`: test state of speech recognition, it arrives that commands are not triggered, or recognition break, so you can test it.
